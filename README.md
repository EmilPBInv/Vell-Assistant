# Vell-Assistant
Virtual Assistant for Raspberry Pi platform and Linux
I had a question... There is Siri for ios and Mac OS, Cortana for Windows OS, Alexa for the Amazon Echo, S Voice for the Samsung Android OS, Google for Cross-platforms. But there isn't anything for the Linux platform (Raspberry Pi too).... So I decided to create the Online Virtual Assistant for Linux or the OVAL(O.V.A.L) It's development is still in process, on my team there is Emil Barranco(Python Coder)github(EmilPBInv) | Daniel Cepeda(Java Coder)github(Energyxxer) and me Jose Barranco(Python Coder, Small Java contributions)github(jdcoding01).
OVAL is just the project's name, but Vell will be the name of the "Personal Assistant"
OVAL is on Beta stage.
